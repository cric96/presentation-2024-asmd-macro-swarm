# MacroSwarm 
Macro Swarm is a field-based libraries for expressing swarm behaviors in a declarative way. It is built on top of the Aggregate computing framework, which is a distributed computing framework for the JVM. Particularly, it is built of top of ScaFi, a scala library for programming aggregate computing systems. The following simulation are built on top of Alchemist -- a meta-simulator for pervasive like systems.

This is the companion repository containing the presentation for the paper sent at COORDINATION 2023 entitled: MacroSwarm: a Field-based Compositional Framework for Swarm Programming
